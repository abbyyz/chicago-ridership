# Chicago CTA Ridership Exploratory Analysis

This project explores the 2024 Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) ridership data, available at [CTA Ridership Data](https://www.transitchicago.com/ridership/). The analysis focuses on identifying usage patterns, seasonal differences, and forecasting daily traffic for selected stations.

## Objectives

- **Find the busiest day for each station**  
  Analyze daily ridership to determine the day with the highest number of rides at each CTA station.

- **Analyze seasonal differences**  
  Compare ridership across different seasons to identify trends and variations in station usage.

- **Forecast daily traffic for selected stations**  
  Develop models to predict the number of rides for one or two stations, using historical data.

## Data Source

- [CTA Ridership Data (2024)](https://www.transitchicago.com/ridership/)

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Collection**  
   Download and preprocess the 2024 daily ridership data for all CTA stations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize ridership trends over time.
   - Identify the busiest day for each station.
   - Analyze seasonal patterns (e.g., winter vs. summer).

3. **Forecasting**  
   - Select one or two stations with significant ridership.
   - Apply time series forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict daily traffic.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the latest CTA ridership data and place it in the project directory.
3. Run the analysis scripts (to be provided) to generate insights and forecasts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- statsmodels / prophet (for forecasting)

## Results

- Summary tables and plots for busiest days per station.
- Seasonal ridership comparison charts.
- Forecast plots for selected stations.
